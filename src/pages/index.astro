			<h1>🌉 Bridge AI OS</h1>

			<p>
				Welcome to the public knowledge layer of <strong>Bridge AI OS</strong> — a human-first
				artificial intelligence operating system built on transparency, ethics, and global inclusion.
			</p>

			<p>
				This site is not marketing content. It is a living record of intent, design decisions,
				system evolution, and real-world impact. Everything documented here exists to ensure that
				artificial intelligence remains accountable to human values.
			</p>

			<p>
				Bridge AI OS is designed to operate as a bridge between humans and autonomous agents.
				Humans provide judgment, context, and values. Agents provide scale, consistency, and
				execution. Neither replaces the other.
			</p>

			<p>
				The platform is built using <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> for its performance,
				simplicity, and content-first philosophy. Static-first architecture ensures global
				accessibility, resilience, and auditability.
			</p>

			<p>From here, you can explore:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>📖 System origins, philosophy, and governance</li>
				<li>🤝 Human ↔ Agent collaboration models</li>
				<li>💰 Transparent value and treasury flows</li>
				<li>🛡 Ethics, safeguards, and compliance logic</li>
				<li>🔧 Engineering logs and system status</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				All content is written to be human-readable by design. If something cannot be explained
				clearly here, it does not belong in the system.
			</p>

			<p>
				This project is active, evolving, and intentionally public. The Bridge is never “finished” —
				it is maintained, reinforced, and extended as technology and humanity move forward together.
